## Solution Goals
* Create a free CLI game based on the popular game "Snake".
* Create a "go to solution" for wasting the time while waiting or procrastinating.
* Widen the amount of entertainment available though CLI (Command Line Interface).

## Functional Eequirements
* Intuitive controls - only 4 buttons for directions.
* Close visual resemblance with the original "Snake".
* Same, simple goal as the original "Snake" - collecting food items on the gameboard.
* Different shapes of the gameboard.
* Score system.
* Persistence of the score and other user information locally.
